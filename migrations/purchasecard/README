Schema migrations for payin.

To create migration locally, from root of repo, run:

  alembic --config migrations/alembic.ini --name purchasecard revision -m "create purchasecard_test table"

Note the --name option above; it is what distinguishes which sub directory of migrations that
generated schema file will be placed in.

To apply migrations locally, from root of repo, run:

  env PURCHASECARD_PAYMENTDB_URL=postgresql://payout_user@0.0.0.0:5435/<paymentdb_test | paymentdb_dev> alembic --config migrations/alembic.ini --name purchasecard upgrade head

The above is only necessary for local testing until a migration target is added into the Makefile.
