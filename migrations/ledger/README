Schema migrations for ledger.

To create migration locally, from root of repo, run:

  alembic --config migrations/alembic.ini --name ledger revision -m "create ledger_test table"

Note the --name option above; it is what distinguishes which sub directory of migrations that
generated schema file will be placed in.

To apply migrations locally, from root of repo, run:

  env LEDGER_PAYMENTDB_URL=<value> alembic --config migrations/alembic.ini --name ledger upgrade head

The above is only necessary for local testing until a migration target is added into the Makefile.
