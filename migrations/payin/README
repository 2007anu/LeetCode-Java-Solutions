Schema migrations for payin.

To create migration locally, from root of repo, run:

  alembic --config migrations/alembic.ini --name payin revision -m "create payin_test table"

Note the --name option above; it is what distinguishes which sub directory of migrations that
generated schema file will be placed in.

To apply migrations locally, from root of repo, run:

  env PAYIN_PAYMENTDB_URL=postgresql://payin_user@0.0.0.0:5435/<paymentdb_test | paymentdb_dev> alembic --config migrations/alembic.ini --name payin upgrade head

The above is only necessary for local testing until a migration target is added into the Makefile.
